# JoystickForCar

This is a joystick for my IoT car which based on MQTT protocol.

## Compile

Yes, I'm using Android studio to develop this project, so you can definitely open it with Android studio, and then you can use your own mobile phone (remember to turn on developer mode) or use a virtual device, and Android studio will automatically detect your device.

## Brief introduction

When you open the app, the first screen you see should look like this.

This is a home page, you can see the basic direction key, on key, adjust speed. You can open the drawer bar on the side. 

At present, it has only two pages, setting page and about page. In fact, there is only one. Because I'm too lazy to give a instance for a useless page -- about page.

To enter the only setting page that actually exists, just long press it.

Here are some basic settings, maybe more in the future.
